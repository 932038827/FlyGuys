# FlyGuys
FlyGuys is simple cheat for FallGuys written in c++. It's internal but can be easily ported to external (that was my goal). It's my first cheat for unity and i know some things can be done better or just use mono injector but it was not my goal like i said. Offsets are updated, but some features may not work because i coded it at closed beta and some things could have changed.
# Features
- Fly mode
- No collisions (you will still get pushed by external forces)
- No stun
- Speed boost
- ESP for real doors (Door rush)
- ESP for real tiles (TipToe)
- ESP for not "jinxed" players
- Unlimited money (probably patched)
- Support for controllers
# Updates
You can just update it easily with ```https://github.com/Perfare/Il2CppDumper``` just put new il2cpp.h and new offsets which you will find in script.json
# TODO
You can do a lot of things myself just look into ```character->fields._data``` and have fun.
